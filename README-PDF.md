## Quick Start

### System Setup

**Automated Installation (Recommended)**

We provide automated installation scripts to ensure you have the correct Node.js version:

**For Linux/WSL:**
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**For Windows:**
```cmd
# Run as Administrator
install.bat
```

These scripts will automatically detect your system and install Node.js v20+ and npm.

**Install pnpm (Recommended Package Manager):**
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

> **Why pnpm?** pnpm is faster, more disk-efficient, and creates a stricter, more reliable dependency resolution than npm. It creates hard links to shared dependencies, saving disk space and improving installation speed.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - *Use our install scripts above if needed*
- **pnpm** (recommended) or **npm** (v8 or higher) - *pnpm is faster and more efficient*

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # With pnpm (recommended)
   pnpm install

   # Or with npm
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   # With pnpm (recommended)
   pnpm start

   # Or with npm
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

The application will automatically reload when you make changes to the source files.

## How to Play

### Basic Gameplay
1. **Choose Game Mode**: Select Human vs Human, Human vs AI, or AI vs AI
2. **Configure Players**: Set each player as Human or AI
3. **Select AI Algorithm**: Choose Minimax or Alpha-Beta for AI players
4. **Make Moves**: Click on empty squares to place your mark

## API Endpoints

The backend provides RESTful endpoints for game management:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/game/state` | GET | Get current game state |
| `/api/game/move` | POST | Make a human move |
| `/api/game/ai-move` | POST | Request AI move |
| `/api/game/reset` | POST | Reset the game |

## Algorithm Details

### Minimax Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Finds the optimal move by exploring all possible game states
- **Complexity**: O(b^d) where b is branching factor and d is depth
- **Characteristics**: Guarantees optimal play but can be slow

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Purpose**: Optimized minimax that eliminates unnecessary branches
- **Optimization**: Typically explores 40-60% fewer nodes
- **Efficiency**: Same optimal results with significantly better performance

### Performance Metrics
- **Nodes Explored**: Number of game states evaluated
- **Execution Time**: Time taken to find the best move
- **Pruning Efficiency**: Percentage of nodes eliminated by alpha-beta
- **Decision Quality**: Comparison of move selection between algorithms
